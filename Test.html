<h4> There Are Eight Planets In Our Solar System </h4>
<h4>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distancefrom the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds </h4>
<p>Venus</p>
<H4> Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Wikipedia
Length of day: 116d 18h 0m
Distance from Sun: 108.2 million km
Orbital period: 225 days
Surface area: 460.2 million km²
Radius: 6,051.8 km
Mass: 4.867 × 10^24 kg (0.815 M⊕)</H4>
<p>Earth</p>
<H4>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.</H4>
<p>Mars</p>
<H4>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". Wikipedia
Gravity: 3.721 m/s²
Length of day: 1d 0h 37m
Distance from Sun: 227.9 million km
Surface area: 144.8 million km²
Orbital period: 687 days
Moons: Phobos, Deimos</H4>
<p>Jupiter</p>
<H4>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Wikipedia
Surface area: 61.42 billion km²
Distance from Sun: 778.5 million km
Radius: 69,911 km
Orbital period: 12 years
Mass: 1.898 × 10^27 kg (317.8 M⊕)
Moons: Europa, Ganymede, Io, Callisto, Amalthea, Himalia, Valetudo, Adrastea, Thebe, Pasiphae, more</H4>
<p Saturn </p>
<H4>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Wikipedia
Distance from Sun: 1.434 billion km
Orbital period: 29 years
Surface area: 42.7 billion km²
Radius: 58,232 km
Mass: 5.683 × 10^26 kg (95.16 M⊕)
Moons: Titan, Enceladus, Mimas, Dione, Tethys, Iapetus, Hyperion, Rhea, Pan, Epimetheus, Phoebe, more</H4>
<p>Uranus </p>
<H4>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares, grandfather of Zeus and father of Cronus. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Wikipedia
Distance from Sun: 2.871 billion km

<p> Neptune </p>
<H4>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Wikipedia
