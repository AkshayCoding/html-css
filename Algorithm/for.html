          <h1>For Loop</h1>
          <h3>In computer science, a for-loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly.<br> 
              Various keywords are used to specify this statement:
               descendants of ALGOL use "for", And the For Behaves Like While Loop But In more Structured Way</h3>
               <p>For Loop Structure</p>
               <p>For(Jumpball ; //Start</p>
               <p>Time On Clock Not Zero //Check</p>
               <p>Countdown) //Step</p>
               <p>Play Blasketball //Action</p>
               <p>Gameover</p>
               <P>A for-loop has two parts: a header specifying the iteration, and a body which is executed once per iteration.
                    The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable,
                    which allows the body to know which iteration is being executed.</P>
