        <h1>Do While</h1>
        <h3>In most computer programming languages, a do while loop is a control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once, and then either repeatedly executes the block, 
            or stops executing it, depending on a given boolean condition at the end of the block.</h3>
           <h4>Do while Structure</h4>
           <p>Jumpball //Start</p>
           <p>do{
               Play BasketBall //Action
           </p>
           <p>Countdown //Step</p>
           <p>]While(time on clock not zero) //Check</p>
           <p>Gameover</p>
           <p>Because do while loops check the condition after the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a post-test loop.
               <br> This means that the code must always be executed first and then the expression or test condition is evaluated. 
             <br>  If it is true, the code executes the body of the loop again.</p>
