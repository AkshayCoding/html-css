        <h1>Data Structure</h1>
        <h3>It is the collection of values and the format they are stored in, relationship between the values in collection as well as the operation applied on the data stored in Structure</h3>
        <p>An array is a collection of homogeneous (same type) data items stored in contiguous memory locations.
             For example if an array is of type “int”, it can only store integer elements and cannot allow the elements of other types such as double, float, char etc.</p>
             <h3>Data Defination</h3>
             <p>
                Data Definition defines a particular data with the following characteristics.
                
                Atomic − Definition should define a single concept.
                
                Traceable − Definition should be able to be mapped to some data element.
                
                Accurate − Definition should be unambiguous.
                
                Clear and Concise − Definition should be understandable.</p>
