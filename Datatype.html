        <h1>There are four data type </h1>
        <p>Derived Data Type
            Those data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are known as derived data types. These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them. For example âˆ’
            
            List <br>
            Array<br>
            Stack<br>
            Queue</p>
            <p>1.List:In computer science, a list or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a countable number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.<br>
                Lists are a basic example of containers, as they contain other values.</p>
                <p>2.Arrays are classified as Homogeneous Data Structures because they store elements of the same type. They can store numbers, strings, boolean values (true and false), characters, objects, and so on.<br>
                    But once you define the type of values that your array will store, all its elements must be of that same type</p>
                    <p>3.Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. <br>
                        The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).<br>
                         There are many real-life examples of a stack.</p>
                         <p>4.Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks.<br>
                             One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). <br>
                            Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.</p>
                            <h2>Linear Search</h2>
                            
                            <p> Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one.<br>
                                 Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection </p>
                                <h2>Binary Search</h2>
                                <p>binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. <br>
                                    Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.</p>
